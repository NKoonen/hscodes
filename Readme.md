# HS Codes 

After installing you can fill in a HS code and country of origin (CO) for each product in the backend of Prestashop.
To view the HS codes and CO on the invoice or delivery slip, you should place a pdf folder in your theme with the custom edits.
(you can find pre-made invoce/delivery slip templates in the pdf folder)
